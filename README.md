# Heating Manager Faerie

## Dependencies

* Current power price in PostgreSQL database (see [Elering NPS Price Grabber](https://github.com/home-faerie/elering-nps-price-grabber))
* MQTT setup to enable/disable heaters

## TODO

* Make it more intelligent than just flipping the button based on price.. ;)
* Get rid of hardcoded values (set price, list of targets)
* Better integration with Home Faerie
